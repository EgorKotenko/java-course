Czar Peter the Great founded St. Petersburg University as part of a new and complete system of science and education in Russia. The system was comprised of three institutions: the Russian Academy of Sciences, the University, and the Academic Gymnasium. In a decree of 28 January 1724, the Senate outlined the purposes of the new institution: “The University is a gathering of learned persons to teach youth such noble sciences as Theology, Law, Medicine, and Philosophy as we know them today.” Prominent men of learning were among the University’s first professors, the mathematicians Euler and Bernoulli, for example. The famous historian and ethnographer, Academician Miller, was appointed in 1747 to be the University’s first rector, a newly created position. The great Russian scholar Mikhail Lomonosov made a significant contribution to the development of the University. He was the University's rector from 1758 to 1765 and taught at the school for a number of years. Lomonosov here introduced the first physics course in Russian in 1747.
